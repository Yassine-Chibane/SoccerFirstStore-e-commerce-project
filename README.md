# Capstone Project

We built an E-commerce website named "Soccer First Store" where you can find your official and authentic soccer jerseys from your favorite club or national team from all around the world. 

# About the project

We built the website with the following features :
A header that contains : Home - New - Shop - Women - Contact
A section where we described the products that we sell
New product section where we listed the new arrivals 
All product section where a customer can pick a product from all the products available for sell
A women products section where you can find women jerseys 
A subscribe section where you can receive, promotions, discounts and more
A contact section where you can contact us about inquiries, special requests ...etc.
A footer where you can explore other sections of the website    


# Technologies used 

We have used during this project the following :

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
​
## Approach taken
​
We started building the structure of the site using mostly HTML. After completing the template of everything we needed to incorporate in our website, we started then using CSS to style each section using Google fonts, icons and Adobe Sparks to remove the background of the pictures uploaded to the site

## Unresolved issues : 

- More time was needed to write a javascript code to maximize a picture when clicked on it with the possibility of seeing a small description, available sizes and the option to add it to cart

- Explore more styling options to make the website more presentable
